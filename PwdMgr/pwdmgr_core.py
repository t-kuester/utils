"""Core Components for simple Password Manager.
by Tobias KÃ¼ster, 2018

This module handles loading, saving, and most importantly, encrypting and
decrypting the password files.

For the first version, I'll just call the command line tools; later I'll
probably switch to some crypto library, but haven't decided which, yet.

In the VERY first iteration this is not doing any encryption at all, just for
testing, so don't use this for your real passwords yet!
