# utils
Some small utility programs that might be useful.

Bib Analyzer
------------
When this is done, its supposed to be a small utility program or library for
analyzing bibliography databases, primarily BibTex.

Some ideas so far:

* group papers by authors, show topics by author and/or year
* show "hot" topics (title words, bigrams, trigrams), possibly as a tag-cloud
* create graphs showing co-author relationsships and author-"cliques"

*very early version*


ES Color Chooser
----------------
The idea behind this program is to use a very simple form of Evolution Strategy
for modifying a color sample until it fits one's needs without having to care
about what exact hue, saturation, or whatever the desired color needs to have.

After picking a color to start, eight similar colors are generated, and after 
picking one of those, another eight similar colors, and so on, until the color
converges to what is wanted.


Quick Reader
------------
A screen reader for quickly 'scanning' long texts by briefly flashing the single
words on the screen.

Not really sure how well this works. Newer really tried it on a longer text...


Sound Delay
-----------
What this program is supposed to do is to capture audio (speech) from the 
microphone and to play it back to the user's headphones with a very small delay
of about 1/20 to 1/10 of a second.

There are some (very expensive) devices, that claim to do the same and are
supposed to have a beneficial effect on stammering. This program is supposed to
replicate this effect. 

Not at all sure whether this actually works, but if it does, I'm planning to 
turn this into an Android app.

Umlaut Escape
-------------
A simple command-line tool for replacing Umlauts in HTML and Latex documents.
